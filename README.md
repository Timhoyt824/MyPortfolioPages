# MyPortfolioPages

## Description 
This is a repsonive multi-page site that will be functioning as a portfolio for me to showcase my projects as I gain more knowledge in web development. This site utilizes html and is built upon the bootstrap framwork. It is fairly bare for now but as I create more content over the next few months I will add/update pages.
